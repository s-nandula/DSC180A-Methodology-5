1) I think the most interesting topic that we covered in our domain this quarter was variety of things that search algorithms have to account for to be as accurate as possible. The initial preprocessing step is extremely important. One example of this is multi-word queries in which the order may appear differently in documents or only some of the words may be in a certain document. Something else that has to be taken into account are plural words or the same word in different tenses. 

2) One potential investigation that I'd be interested in pursuing for my Quarter 2 Project is creating a search algorithm to search over all the past DSC Capstone Projects. It would be really cool to use all the concepts I've learned about search this quarter and apply it to something that all DSC students can use.

3) I think one potential change I would make to the approach we took for our Quarter 1 project would have been to explore more types of searches before diving into the project itself. If we explored each search individually first, it would've been easier to see whcih search worked best in different scenarios. We combined different types of searches too early in the process.

4) I would be interested in using a model in which the type of search used or the weight of each search changes based on what is being searched for. For example, if a more complicated query is given, a combination of different search methods may be used to gather results. If a simpler query is used, a keyword search method may suffice.
